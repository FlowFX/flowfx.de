# What I'm doing at the moment

_(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)_

I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

-   working as a backend developer at [ioki](<https://ioki.com/>),
-   serving as a member of ioki's first works council,
-   practicing my trombone under the guidance of [Ralf-Werner Kopp](<https://der-trompetenlehrer.de/>),
-   rehearsing and playing with [The Uplifters &amp; Block Ice Horn Section](<https://theuplifters.de/>),
-   training at [muskeltiere Mannheim](<https://www.muskeltiere-sport.de/>), or kettlebelling in my garden.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was July 15, 2024.
