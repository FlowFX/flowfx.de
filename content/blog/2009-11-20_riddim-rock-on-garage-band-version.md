<p>Here's a new riddim idea. It's a song mostly in A major, based on the classic changes to C and D. Got the idea from <a title="King Floyd - Groove Me" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7hEyTghGd4">King Floyd's / The Blues Brothers' "Groove Me"</a>. Haven't played it with my band yet, so I'm still curious what it will sound like.
