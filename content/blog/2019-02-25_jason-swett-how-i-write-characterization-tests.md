Yupp. That's a problem. [How I write characterization
tests](https://www.codewithjason.com/write-characterization-tests/) shows a
technique for how to deal with this situation. I, too, use tests to figure out
how a piece of code actually works. Works better for me than actually
reading the code. ðŸ¤¨
