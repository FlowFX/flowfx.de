[My search for a new job](/blog/looking-for-work-django-developer-can-do-a-lot) has been successful. I'm starting a new position as a Ruby-On-Rails developer with a company at the  Frankfurt Airport on May 2nd (I will commute from Mannheim). In the end it took me 4 months, 7 applications, 5 interviews and 2 job offers. This doesn't sound too bad, but still, it's not an experience I want to repeat anytime soon.

*Check my [Now page](/now) to see where I'm currently at in the process of moving back to Germany.*

> Wait. Rails?

Yupp. Rails.

I'll need to update the about page.

To hear what it feels like to leave Mexico and start something completely new, you'll have to listen to one of the next episodes of [Several Ways To Live](https://severalwaystolive.com/). There Nick and I will discuss the coming-home part of being an expat.

Let me just quickly give you an incomplete and unordered list of things I am looking forward to in Germany:

- Döner Kebap
- my friends
- my family
- silence
- good beer
- bike tours
- chaos events
- my Reggae band
- clean air
- forests
- good bread
- cross-country skiing
- drinking beer in public
- Rindsrouladen
- affordable good cheese
- affordable good sausage
- public swimming pools
- lactose-free butter

Oh, yes. Döner!!
