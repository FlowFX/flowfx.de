title: Update August 2018

Working a full-time job in an office is something different. Add 3 hours of commute each day, and my life is a lot different than it was a year ago. I firmly believe that I'm about as productive now than I was when I was working fewer hours but alone in my home office. But that's for another day.

More time to and at work means a lot less time for other things, which is something I am still struggling to get used to. Combine that with having moved across the Atlantic, finding and moving into a new apartment, and dealing with German bureaucracy! All things considered, I guess I'm dealing with it pretty well.

Still, I had to pause a lot of activities during the last four months, including this blog. As I'm learning a new programming language (Ruby) and a new web framework (Rails), there should be enough fun topics to write about (There are). Just like last year with Django and software testing. But who has the time? Not me at the moment. At least I played my first gig with my old band two weeks ago. That was good, and it won't be the last time.

Lastly, in case you're reading this and wonder why, after almost four months back in Germany, I haven't managed to come visit you: I'm sorry, I'm working on it. In the meantime, our guestroom is large, has an even larger bed and is open to you anytime!
