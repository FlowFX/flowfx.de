This past spring I was looking for a local band to support [The Uplifters](https://theuplifters.de/) at a concert I was setting up in Mannheim in June. "Support" meaning: draw a few more people than we would by ourselves - us being from Freiburg and not well known here yet. In the course of this search, I met [The Offbeat Service](https://www.instagram.com/theoffbeatservice/) from Worms. They couldn't play the date, but they told us about a nice little festival around the corner in Dorsheim, the ["Acker-Kult"](http://ackerkult.de/). They were still looking for bands, and they liked us.

The originally planned concert in Mannheim never happened. Instead, we played a great show at Acker-Kult, I now play _with_ The Offbeat Service, and we finally have some decent live videos to present. Enjoy!
