I have added the [/music](/music) page to collect everything related to my musical activities. Most importantly, this is where I will list the dates for all my upcoming gigs. More will come later.

I have also created a [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) account on [MakerTube](https://makertube.net/) to collect all videos of me playing with my bands. If you're on the Fediverse you can subscribe to the [flowfx_music@makertube.net](https://makertube.net/c/flowfx_music/videos) channel. The most recent video there is a compilation of videos shot at my recent gig at [Die Funzel](https://www.instagram.com/diefunzel) with [The Offbeat Service](https://www.instagram.com/theoffbeatservice/):
