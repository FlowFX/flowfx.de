There are many crappy hosting providers. In fact, almost all of them are crappy.

Almost.

[DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2080860) is awesome!

In their standard [shared-hosting plan](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/shared/) they provide:

- unlimited webspace
- unlimited MySQL databases
- unlimited email accounts
- unlimited user accounts
    - with separate web spaces
    - with SSH access
        - [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/) pre-installed
- free [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates for every domain and subdomain
- up-to-date PHP and MySQL versions
- excellent and friendly customer support

(to be continuedâ€¦)


They do offer domain registration as well, but I prefer using [Hover](https://hover.com/mdaQ1dJv) for this. In cases where everything else is on DreamHost, I just switch the domain's name servers to the DreamHost name servers. And it just works.

By now, I recommend DreamHost to everyone who asks, especially to all my clients.
