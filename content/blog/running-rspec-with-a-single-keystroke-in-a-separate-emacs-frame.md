Find it in [my Emacs config](https://codeberg.org/flowfx/emacs.d).

Don't open a new buffer for RSpec if one already exists. Also, don't move the focus.

```elisp
(add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
           '("\\*rspec-compilation\\*" . (nil (reusable-frames . t) (inhibit-switch-frame . t))))
```
