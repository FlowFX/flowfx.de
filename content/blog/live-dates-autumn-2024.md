I'll be playing a surprising number of shows until the end of the year, both with my long-term band [The Uplifters &amp; Block Ice Horn Section](https://theuplifters.de/), the band that I just recently joined, [The Offbeat Service](https://www.instagram.com/theoffbeatservice/) (mostly 2-tone Ska from Worms), and the very fun rock-pop-funk cover band [Marshall Pfefferle](https://www.instagram.com/marshallpfefferle/) from Heidelberg:
