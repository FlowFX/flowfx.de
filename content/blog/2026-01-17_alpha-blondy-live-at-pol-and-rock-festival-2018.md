Alpha Blondy &amp; The Solar System are probably my favorite live performers. I first saw them play at Chiemsee Reggae Summer in 2010, and once again [2016 in Mexico City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgHtpGa1wU). Their live sound is perfect. It's huge, precise, and clear. Of course I can't properly describe it, nor would it help you feel it. I can only encourage you to go see them as long as they're around!

Then you will witness an amazing show like this one from Poland in 2018 which I love listening to:
