title: The Uplifters - Live im Proberaum
---

I have [an awesome band](https://theuplifters.de/)! In December we recorded a few songs "live" in our rehearsal room in Freiburg, both audio and video. Over the winter everybody but me put _a lot_ of work into pulling both together and making it look and sound good. And what can I say, they did an amazing job. I'm truly impressed. Plus: everything was done using free and open source software: [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) and [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/)!

Well, here they are, two of our original songs, live in the studio:

If you want to see us play live sometime, head over to [theuplifters.de](https://theuplifters.de) and sign up to our newsletter! We only send out emails when we have public gigs to announce. Of course you can always book us for your private garden party as well. ðŸ˜ƒ
