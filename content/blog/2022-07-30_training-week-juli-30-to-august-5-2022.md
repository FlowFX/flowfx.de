Since [my training log project](https://github.com/FlowFX/divingdolphin) is
going nowhere, I might as well log my training here, if just for a few weeks.

After a 11 day training break due to Covid I have to ramp back up slowly into my
ongoing volume cycles of clean & press and one-handed club swinging. I am also
trying to start a cycle of Goblet squats in order to add ... more squats to my
training. I think I need them.

| Day | Exercise                                                                     | Weights and reps         | timing / notes                                        |

\*: 3 rung reverse ladder goes 3 left, 3 right, 2 left, 2 right, 1 left, 1 right  
\*\*: x reps of slow (!) heel drops with a bent knee, then x reps with a
straight knee. Repeat on the other side. KB is held on the side that's doing the
drops. Full range of motion, but don't hold the bottom stretch (my damaged
achilles tendon doesn't like that).
