My name is Florian Posdziech. I'm a software
[developer](/categories/tech/ "blog articles from category tech"),
[musician](/categories/music/ "music-related blog posts"),
[athlete](/categories/training/), and occasional
[podcaster](/categories/podcaster/).
I currently live in Mannheim, Germany and work as a backend developer
for [ioki](https://ioki.com/) in Frankfurt am Main.

I like reggae music, baseball, fish tacos, and beer. I've lived, studied and worked in the USA, Norway and Mexico. Maybe it shows.

Check my [Now page](/now) to see what I'm up to at the moment.

## What I do

### Music

I play the trombone in the Reggae and Ska band [_The Uplifters & Block Ice Horn Section_](https://theuplifters.de/konzerte) from Freiburg, and the 2-tone and Rocksteady band [_The Offbeat Service_](https://www.instagram.com/theoffbeatservice/) from Worms.

### Training

At any time I train one or more of either running, kettlebelling, heavy club swinging, [CrossFit](https://www.muskeltiere-sport.de/), strength training, body building, or rucking.

### Coding

I do most of my coding for work, so the only public repositories that I regularly touch are my configuration files:

- [My dotfiles](https://codeberg.org/flowfx/dotfiles) for Vim, tmux, zsh, i3, and such, and
- my [Emacs config](https://codeberg.org/flowfx/emacs.d).

### Podcasts

Sometimes I talk into a microphone.

**[Several Ways To Live (in Mexico City)](https://severalwaystolive.com/)**: An English podcast that I record together with my friend [Nick Farr](https://chaos.social/web/accounts/1767). It used to be about Mexican food and culture. Now it's something else.

<!-- **[Tacos und Limetten](https://tacosundlimetten.de/)**: A German podcast where I talk to fellow and former expats in Mexico City. -->

**[Cultural Comments - der C3S-Podcast](https://podcast.c3s.cc/)**: A German podcast by and for the C3S, an upcoming alternative to the GEMA collecting sociaty.
