# Resume

**Florian Posdziech. Software Developer.**

I am not a computer scientist. I'm a physicist by training and
musician by passion. But I've been working with computers my whole
life. I wrote my first HTML in the 90s and started developing websites
professionally with WordPress around 2010.

2016, while living in Mexico, I finally picked up Python and Django in
order to develop more serious web applications. I got my first paid
project in 2017 and have been working in the field ever since.

I like

- working in a team of equals, where mistakes are not problems but things that are discussed and learned from.
- asking stupid questions and getting them answered.
- testing. Without tests there can be no code.

I prefer

- working part-time. Currently I work Mondays through Thursdays, and it greatly benefits my well-being and the quality of my work.
- not working on stupid things like cars, bitcoin, or advertising.

## Relevant job experience

- _Since September 2019:_ **Backend Developer at [ioki GmbH](https://ioki.com/), Frankfurt.**  
  We work with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and all the other fun
  standard stuff. My teammates and my lead [Andreas
  Schwarzkopf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-schwarzkopf/) are incredibly
  skilled, and I am learning a ton from them. Sometimes I can teach them as
  well.

  I hosted our internal series of tech-focused lightning talks for a few years.

  My most impactful contribution to our code base is probably the
  [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
  I wrote for implementing the - extremely diverse - price systems of
  public transport providers.

  Proudest achievement: I co-initiated ioki's first works council election.

- _May 2018 - Aug 2019:_ **Software Developer Ruby on Rails at CHI Deutschland Cargo Handling GmbH, Frankfurt.**  
  Looking for a job in the Rhein-Main-Neckar area, I overlooked the requirement for
  _Ruby_ skills in one job ad. [Daniel Loy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-loy-8b42a8a9/) hired me anyways and
  thus jumpstarted my career as a Rails developer. We now work together at ioki,
  so everything worked out fine.

  Proudest achievement: I successfully replaced Jira with GitHub issues for the team's task management.

- _Jan 2017 - Dec 2017:_ **Software Developer Python at Lexa.mx, Mexico City.**  
  After teaching myself the basics of web development using Python in the
  previous year, I got the opportunity to build the prototype for a SaaS startup from
  the ground up. I used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as the framework,
  [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) for hosting,
  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for templating and typesetting
  documents, and I fell in love with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

  This was a super interesting collaboration between lawyers, designers, and me
  as the developer. While the product never went anywhere, you can still find
  the designs in my friend [Ang√©lica Ramos's portfolio](https://angelica-ramos.com/portfolio/lexa/).

  Coolest story to tell: How I tested the LaTeX templates for legal documents using pytest.

- _Sep 2013 - Jul 2014:_ **Bartender at the [Ganter brewery experience](https://www.ganter-brauerlebnis.de/), Freiburg.**  
  Learned to draw the perfect beer.

## Education

- _2002 - 2008:_ **Studied physics in Freiburg and Trondheim.**  
  Diplom / M.Sc. in physics. Thesis: _Mathematical modelling of the JAK2-STAT5 signalling pathway_.
