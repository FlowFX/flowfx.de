Dear recruiters, please don't contact me with any current job offers. At the
moment, I am extremely happy working at ioki.

---

Starting 2023, I will be looking for a new job that requires the following:

- Fully remote work and team. I will be moving to somewhere in Latin America in 2024 or later.
- Part-time employment. I currently work Mondays through Thursdays, and it greatly benefits my well-being and the quality of my work.
- Nothing stupid like cars, bitcoin, or advertising.

## Relevant job experience

- _Since September 2019:_ **Backend Developer at [ioki GmbH](https://ioki.com/), Frankfurt.**  
  We work with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and
  all the other fun standard stuff. My teammates are incredibly skilled, and I
  am learning a ton from them. Sometimes I can teach them as well. While it's
  not hard coding-wise, I have the most fun translating public transport pricing
  systems into human- and machine-readable code. And writing tests of course.

    I host our internal series of tech-focused lightning talks.

- _May 2018 - Aug 2019:_ **Software Developer Ruby on Rails at CHI Deutschland Cargo Handling GmbH, Frankfurt.**  
  Looking for a job in the Rhein-Main-Neckar area, I overlooked the requirement for
  _Ruby_ skills in one job ad. [Daniel Loy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-loy-8b42a8a9/) hired me anyways and
  thus jumpstarted my career as a Rails developer. We now work together at ioki,
  so everything worked out fine.

- _Jan 2017 - Dec 2017:_ **Software Developer Python at Lexa.mx, Mexico City.**  
  After teaching myself the basics of web development using Python in the
  previous year, I got the opportunity to build the prototype for a SaaS startup from
  the ground up. I used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as the framework,
  [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) for hosting,
  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for templating and typesetting
  documents, and I fell in love with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

    This was a super interesting collaboration between lawyers, designers, and me
  as the developer. While the product never went anywhere, you can still find
  the designs in my friend [Ang√©lica Ramos's portfolio](https://angelica-ramos.com/portfolio/lexa/).

- _Sep 2013 - Jul 2014:_ **Bartender at the [Ganter brewery experience](https://www.ganter-brauerlebnis.de/), Freiburg.**  
  Learned to draw the perfect beer.

## Education

- _2002 - 2008:_ **Studied physics in Freiburg and Trondheim.**  
  Diplom / M.Sc. in physics.
