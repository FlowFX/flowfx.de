Dear recruiters, please don't contact me with any current job offers. At the
moment, I am extremely happy working at ioki.

***

Starting 2023, I will be looking for a new job that requires the following:

- Fully remote work and team. I will be moving to somewhere in Latin America in 2024 or later.
- Part-time employment. I do my best work working Mondays through Thursdays.
- Nothing stupid like cars or bitcoin.


## Relevant job experience

- *Since September 2019:* **Backend Developer at [ioki GmbH](https://ioki.com/), Frankfurt**  
  We work with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and all the other fun standard stuff. My teammates are incredibly
  skilled, and I am learning a ton from them. Sometimes I can teach them as well. While it's not hard coding-wise, I
  have the most fun translating public transport pricing systems into human- and machine-readable code. And writing
  tests of course.

- *May 2018 - Aug 2019:* **Software Developer Ruby on Rails at CHI Deutschland Cargo Handling GmbH, Frankfurt**
