My name is Florian Posdziech. I'm a software developer, trombone player, runner, and
occasional podcaster. I am currently working as a backend developer for
[ioki](https://ioki.com/) in Frankfurt, Germany.

I like reggae music, baseball, fish tacos, and beer. I've lived, studied and worked in the USA, Norway and Mexico. Maybe it shows.

Check my [Now page](link://slug/now) to see what I'm up to at the moment.

_Recruiters_, please read [my resume](link://slug/resume) before contacting me.

## What I do

### Music

I play the trombone for the Reggae and Ska band \*_The Uplifters & Block Ice Horn Section_ from Freiburg.

You'll find our next gigs at [theuplifters.de/termine](https://theuplifters.de/termine).

### Training

[I run](https://runalyze.com/athlete/flowfx), and I train with kettlebells. Sometimes I join my wife for some CrossFit-like training at our friend's gym [muskeltiere](https://www.muskeltiere-sport.de/) in the Jungbusch.

### Coding

I do most of my coding for work, so the only public repositories that I regularly touch are my configuration files:

- [My dotfiles](https://codeberg.org/flowfx/dotfiles) for Vim, tmux, zsh, i3, and such,
- a [Doom Emacs configuration](https://codeberg.org/flowfx/doom.d), and
- an [Ansible playbook](https://codeberg.org/flowfx/ansible-localhost) for my everything not covered by the dotfiles.

<strike>From time to time</strike> Never do I spend time on [my pet project](https://github.com/FlowFX/divingdolphin).

### Podcasts

Sometimes I talk with friends into microphones.

**[Several Ways To Live (in Mexico City)](https://severalwaystolive.com/)**: An English podcast that I record together with my friend [Nick Farr](https://chaos.social/web/accounts/1767). It used to be about Mexican food and culture. Now it's something else.

**[Tacos und Limetten](https://tacosundlimetten.de/)**: A German podcast where I talk to fellow expats in Mexico City.

**[Cultural Comments - der C3S-Podcast](https://podcast.c3s.cc/)**: A German podcast by and for the C3S, an upcoming alternative to the GEMA.
