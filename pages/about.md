<img src="/images/flowfx-2019.jpg" alt="Florian Posdziech headshot" style="width:100%;max-width:250px">

My name is Florian Posdziech. I'm a trained physicist, amateur musician, runner,
recreational podcaster, and am currently working as a backend developer for
[ioki](https://ioki.com/) in Frankfurt, Germany.

I like reggae music, baseball, fish tacos and beer. I've lived, studied and worked in the USA, Norway and Mexico. Maybe it shows.

Check my [Now page](link://slug/now) to see what I'm up to at the moment.

_Recruiters_, please check [my resume](link://slug/resume) before contacting me.
