## Podcasts

I am an avid podcast listener. My recommendations are: [Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) by Dan Carlin (especially the WW1 and Djingis Khan series), [The Poscast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-poscast/id757346885) (pure sillyness), and in German, of course [Logbuch:Netzpolitik](https://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/).

I also produce podcasts of my own: [Cultural Comments](#) – the C3S podcast and [Tacos und Limetten](https://tacosundlimetten.de/), about Mexico.

## Life
I have lived, studied and worked in 4 different countries by now. Germany, of course, Rhode Island, USA as a High School senior, Norway as a University student, and currently Mexico, as a husband to a teacher.

I've been a student, researcher, IT consultant, bike courier, tutor, teacher, systems administrator, web developer and probably some more

My journey to being able to honestly calling myself a developer or coder was long and slow. But I finally made it. [How I learned to code](#).

I like testing stuff, and I especially like testing stuff with pytest. So [I write about how I'm using pytest](http://flowfx.de/categories/pytest/) from time to time.

If you really, really want to, you can check out my [CV](/cv/).

As for web development, I must consider myself pretty old-school. My most advanced adventures in the Frontend world are with jQuery and VueJS. But I'm learning every day. Whether I want to or not.

*****

I took my first steps with Linux in 2004, while living in Trondheim. There, I finally had a room-mate that knew her stuff and could teach me. I went all in with Gentoo Linux. Later came Debian, Ubuntu and Arch. If I had a second machine for work besides my MacBook, I'd put Arch LInux on it.

### Typesetting

I'm a pysicist by training, so I _love_ [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). 

As every sane person does, I love [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), too.

*****

I played with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) for a while, using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and everything, and it taught me a lot. Then I seriously tried out [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and I'm not moving back anytime soon. The Django magic is the right thing for me. Its ORM as well.

*****

The only editor I can really work with anymore is [VIM](http://www.vim.org/). Most of my time I spend in the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) IDE in VIM mode.
