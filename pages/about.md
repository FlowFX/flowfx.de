## Podcasts

I am an avid podcast listener. My recommendations are: [Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) by Dan Carlin (especially the WW1 and Djingis Khan series), [The Poscast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-poscast/id757346885) (pure sillyness), and in German, of course [Logbuch:Netzpolitik](https://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/).

I also produce podcasts of my own: [Cultural Comments](#) – the C3S podcast and [Tacos und Limetten](https://tacosundlimetten.de/), about Mexico. Newest addition to this list is [Several Ways To Live In Mexico City](https://severalwaystolive.com/), an English speaking podcast about life and food in Mexico.

## Projects

2017 I co-created the web app for the Mexican LegalTech startup [Lexa.mx](https://www.lexa.mx/). This also lead to publishing my first package on PyPI, [Postalcodes Mexico](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/postalcodes-mexico).

[Reggae CDMX](https://www.reggae-cdmx.com/) is intended to be a community-edited calendar for all Reggae and Dub related events in Mexico City, and will be run by my friend [Jahshua](https://www.facebook.com/Jahshua-402515579860168). The goal of [Unkenmathe](https://github.com/FlowFX/unkenmathe.de) is to provide a resource of exercises and exercise sheets for German mathematics teachers.

This website is generated with [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/). You can find my GitHub profile on … [GitHub](https://github.com/flowfx/).
