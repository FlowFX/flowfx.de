My name is Florian Posdziech. I'm a trained physicist, amateur musician, podcaster, and am currently working as a backend developer for [ioki](https://ioki.com/) in Frankfurt, Germany.

I like reggae music, baseball, fish tacos and beer. This is mostly because I've been a frequent expat, having lived, studied and worked in the USA, Norway and Mexico.

Check my [Now page](link://slug/now) to see what I'm up to at the moment.

## Projects

**[Several Ways To Live (in Mexico City)](https://severalwaystolive.com/)**: An English podcast that I record together with my friend [Nick Farr](https://chaos.social/web/accounts/1767). It used to be about Mexican food and culture. Now it's something else.

*The Block Ice Horn Section*: A 4-man horn section playing Reggae and Ska music, most often with **The Uplifters** from Freiburg.

*Dolby Frontal*: A rock cover band based in Heidelberg.
