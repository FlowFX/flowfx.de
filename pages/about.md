<p>My name is Florian Posdziech. I'm a trained physicist, amateur musician and am currently working as a Ruby on Rails developer at [CHI](http://www.chi-deutschland.com/) in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

<p>I like reggae music, baseball, fish tacos and beer. This is mostly because I've been a frequent expat, having lived, studied and worked in the USA, Norway and Mexico.</p>

<p>Check my <a href="link://slug/now">Now page</a> to see what I'm up to at the moment.
