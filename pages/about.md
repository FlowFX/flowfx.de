<p>My name is Florian Posdziech. I'm a trained physicist, amateur musician and am currently working as a Ruby on Rails developer at <a href="http://www.chi-deutschland.com/">CHI</a> in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

<p>I like reggae music, baseball, fish tacos and beer. This is mostly because I've been a frequent expat, having lived, studied and worked in the USA, Norway and Mexico.</p>

<p>Check my <a href="link://slug/now">Now page</a> to see what I'm up to at the moment.

## Current Projects

**[Several Ways To Live (in Mexico City)](https://severalwaystolive.com/)**: An English podcast that I record together with my friend [Nick Farr](https://chaos.social/web/accounts/1767). It used to be about Mexican food and culture. Now it's something else.
