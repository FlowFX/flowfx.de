_(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)_

I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- practicing my trombone under the guidance of [Ralf-Werner Kopp](https://der-trompetenlehrer.de/),
- regularly playing with both my Freiburg- and Heidelberg-based bands,
- training with my kettlebells and heavy clubs, and
- sometimes running.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was August 8, 2022.
