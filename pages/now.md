*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- regularly training at [CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/),
- and playing my trombone in a new band. :)

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was September 2nd, 2020.
