*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm in Mannheim,

- truly enjoying my new job as a Full Stack / [Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/) developer,
- studying methods of agile software development,
- solving bureaucratic challenges that moving here from another country inevitably involves,
- meeting lots of friends that I haven't seen in years, and
- very much enjoying life in Germany.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was June 24th, 2018.
