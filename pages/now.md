*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/) - at home of course -,
- training at home using mostly kettlebells and heavy clubs,
- treating my damaged Achilles tendon so I can go running again soon,
- playing my trombone from time to time (our neighbors love me!), and
- planning fun summer trips that may or may not work out this year.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was March 23rd, 2021.
