_(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)_

I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- running,
- kettlebelling,
- playing the trombone with both my bands, and
- finally taking trombone lessons to maybe someday actually know what I'm doing.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was April 5th, 2022.
