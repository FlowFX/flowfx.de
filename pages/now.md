*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- still working as a [Ruby on Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/) developer in Frankfurt,
- looking hard for a new job that's closer to home,
- playing with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize editor commands and programming languages,
- listening through the back catalogue of [The Dollop](https://www.dolloppodcast.com/),
- and very much enjoying life in Germany.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was March 9th, 2019.
