*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- training at Mannheim's newest sports club [muskeltiere](https://www.muskeltiere-sport.de/),
- slowly building up my running mileage, and
- playing with my Heidelberg-based rock cover band again (yay!!).

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was September 2nd, 2021.
