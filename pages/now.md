*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- going for easy runs 4 to 5 times per week,
- while also training at [CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/),
- recording episodes of [Several Ways To Live](https://severalwaystolive.com/),
- and waiting to resume playing music with my band mates.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was July 5th, 2020.
