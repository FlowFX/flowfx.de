*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- slowly increasing my running activities,
- while also training at [CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/),
- recording episodes of [Several Ways To Live](https://severalwaystolive.com/) and [Cultural Comments](https://podcast.c3s.cc/),
- and playing sweet reggae music with The Uplifters & Block Ice Horn Section.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was January 14th, 2020.
