*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- working as a **Ruby on Rails** developer in Frankfurt,
- looking forward to starting my new job at [ioki](https://ioki.com/) in September,
- studying [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist) and 
  [Practical Object-Oriented Design](http://www.informit.com/store/practical-object-oriented-design-an-agile-primer-using-9780134456478?ranMID=24808),
- using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize what I'm learning,
- recording new episodes of [Several Ways To Live](https://severalwaystolive.com/) and [Cultural Comments](https://podcast.c3s.cc/),
- training at [CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/),
- and very much enjoying life in Germany.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was June 24th, 2019.
