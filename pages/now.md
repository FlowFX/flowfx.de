*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm back in Mannheim for good,

- figuring out my new job as a Full Stack / [Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/) developer,
- podcasting with [Nick](https://chaos.social/@nickfarr) & friends,
- being totally overwhelmed by all the things, but
- very much enjoying my new life in Germany.

<!-- - reading book 6 of the phenomenal *[Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series))* series by James S. A. Corey, and -->

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was May 14th, 2018.
