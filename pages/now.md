*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- <strike>regularly sometimes training at ~[CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/)</strike>
- <strike>and playing my trombone in a new band. :)</strike>
- training at home using mostly kettlebells,
- going for walks along the Neckar river, and
- waiting for Corona times to end.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was January 10th, 2021.
