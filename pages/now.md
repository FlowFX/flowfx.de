*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm back in Mannheim for good,

- working as a Full Stack / [Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/) developer in Frankfurt,
- furnishing and setting up our new apartment,
- listening through the back catalogue of [The Dollop](https://www.dolloppodcast.com/),
- meeting lots of friends that I haven't seen in years, and
- very much enjoying life in Germany.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was August 3rd, 2018.
