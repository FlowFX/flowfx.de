_(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)_

I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- running 30+ kilometers per week,
- still regularly moving the kettlebell,
- playing the trombone with both my bands, and,
- after 30 years of learning by doing, finally taking trombone lessons. My teacher is [Ralf-Werner Kopp](https://der-trompetenlehrer.de/) in Heidelberg, and I can wholeheartedly recommend him.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was April 8th, 2022.
