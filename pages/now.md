*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/) - at home of course -,
- training at home using mostly kettlebells and heavy clubs,
- cautiously starting to run, jog, walk again,
- with my new [running sandals](https://gofreeconcepts.de/collections/shamma-sandals/products/shamma-sandals-warriors-mit-ultragrip-fussbett),
- rehearsing with my Heidelberg-based rock cover band again (yay!!), and
- helping out with starting the new sports club [muskeltiere](https://muskeltiere-sport.de/) in Mannheim Jungbusch.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was June 22nd, 2021.
