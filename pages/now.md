_(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)_

I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- running (again ðŸ™Œ), kettlebelling, and sometimes barbelling,
- [Studying Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/),
- falling deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole that is Emacs, and
- playing with my Heidelberg-based rock cover band (yay!!).

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was December 27th, 2021.
