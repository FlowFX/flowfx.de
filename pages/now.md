*(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)*


I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- working as a [Ruby on Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/) developer in Frankfurt,
- very much looking forward to start my new job at [ioki](https://ioki.com/) in September,
- playing with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize editor commands and programming languages,
- recording new episodes of [Several Ways To Live](https://severalwaystolive.com/),
- and very much enjoying life in Germany.

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was May 23rd, 2019.
