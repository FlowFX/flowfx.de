_(This is [a Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). Where's yours?)_

I'm living in Mannheim, Germany,

- happily working as a backend developer at [ioki](https://ioki.com/),
- slowly but steadily increasing my running mileage (Yay! ðŸ™Œ),
- kettlebelling - currently running Clean & Press and Swing programs,
- (sometimes) [Studying Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/),
- using Emacs everyday - but still loving the Vim+tmux combo for work, and
- playing loud music with my Heidelberg-based rock (funk? pop?) cover band (ðŸ¤˜).

When my activities or priorities change, Iâ€™ll update this page. Last update was January 13th, 2022.
