Or: *Back To The Mac 1*

After using only Linux machines for work for the past 5 years, my next machine will be a MacBook. That's why I'm working on improving my development environment on macOS as best as I can now, something that's not really been necessary when using my personal Mac.

First order of business: how do I start the Emacs server and connect to it with the emacsclient?

I'm using [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs+]] from homebrew:

#+begin_src shell
  brew install emacs-plus@29
#+end_src

Once installed, it works fine, but neither do Spotlight - or Alfred - see any Emacs.app, nor do I know how to start the server or start multiple clients that connect to it.

I found the solution on the blog of one Alex Balgavy: [[https://blog.alex.balgavy.eu/setting-up-emacs-as-a-daemon-on-macos/][Setting up Emacs as a daemon on macOS]]. Then I simplified it for my purposes.

All I needed to do is create a new [[https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/automator/welcome/mac][Automator]] document of type /Application/ that runs this shell script:

#+begin_src shell
  export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
  emacsclient -c -a '' >/dev/null 2>&1 &
#+end_src

`-c` creates a GUI frame, and `-a ''` connects to the server named `''` - or starts it if it's not already running.

Every time I call *Emacs.app*, I get a new fresh Emacs window, just like I'm used to on my Linux machine that runs the Emacs server from systemd.

I have [[https://theuplifters.de/][an awesome band]]! In December we recorded a few songs "live" in our rehearsal room in Freiburg, both audio and video. Over the winter everybody but me put /a lot/ of work into pulling both together and making it look and sound good. And what can I say, they did an amazing job. I'm truly impressed. Plus: everything was done using free and open source software: [[https://ardour.org/][Ardour]] and [[https://kdenlive.org/][kdenlive]]!

Well, here they are, two of our original songs, live in the studio:

*** Be Free

If you want to see us play live sometime, head over to [[https://theuplifters.de][theuplifters.de]] and sign up to our newsletter! We only send out emails when we have public gigs to announce. Of course you can always book us for your private garden party as well. ðŸ˜ƒ
