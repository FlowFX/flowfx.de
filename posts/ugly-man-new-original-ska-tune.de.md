<html><body><p>"Ugly Man" is an original ska tune by me with help from <a href="http://www.theuplifters.de">The Uplifters &amp; Block Ice Horn Section</a>. Lyrics are from <a href="https://myspace.com/crimedabime">a crime don't come alone</a>. It was first performed November 21st 2009. The recording so far is a rough rehearsal recording without lyrics, solos or such:
