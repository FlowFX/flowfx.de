I spent the last few days in Dublin, Ireland, visiting a very good friend of mine. These are a few observations I made during my stay:

* The Irish consider themselves much less European than I had thought.
* Mainland Europe is simply called "Europe".
* They hate the English.
* Until recently, Ireland had been living in the Middle Ages, as is accurately portrayed in the 1991 movie [The Commitments](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101605/?ref_=nv_sr_1).
* They frickin' **love** The Commitments.
* Germans are forgiven for not knowing anything about Rugby.
* I have a better chance of catching an SC Freiburg match in Dublin than I do in Mannheim. 
* They know how to make a good breakfast.
* They call Americano an Americano.
* Guinness is owned by big alcohol and employs mob tactics to block other beer makers from getting their products into pubs.
* Irish pub culture is as strong and real as it is advertised. Loving it!
