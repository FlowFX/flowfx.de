Yes, my training week starts on Saturday.

| Day | Exercise                                                                     | Weights and reps | timing / notes                 |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Sat | [**Single Arm Inside Circle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZzoCasyoAM)  | 6kg x 11 x 5/5   | 2min rest before next exercise |
|     | [**Single Arm Outside Circle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OydLETgLfMA) | 6kg x 11 x 5/5   | 2min rest before next exercise |
|     | [**Single Arm Shield Cast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKNgPDX2wRk)    | 6kg x 11 x 5/5   |                                |
|     | **"FlowFX Heel Drop Complex"**\*                                             | 20kg x 3 x 4/4   | start every 115s (~35s rest)   |

\*: x reps of slow (!) heel drops with a bent knee, then x reps with a straight
knee. Repeat on the other side. The weight is held on the side that's doing the
drops. Full range of motion, but don't hold the bottom stretch (my damaged
achilles tendon doesn't like that).
