Write good stuff here.

Uber is not a nice company. 

- safe, clean cars with seatbelts and working breaks
- Waze for navigation and traffic information
- no rip-off by the drivers, fixed price in advance
- cautious drivers
- safe for drunken and late-night rides

Uber the only company offering that level of service here.
