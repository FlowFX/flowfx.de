I have [an awesome band](https://theuplifters.de/)! In December we recorded a few songs "live" in our rehearsal room in Freiburg, both audio and video. Over the winter everybody but me put _a lot_ of work into pulling both together and making it look and sound good. And what can I say, they did an amazing job. I'm truly impressed. Plus: everything was done using free and open source software: [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) and [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/)!

Well, here they are, two of our original songs, live in the studio:
