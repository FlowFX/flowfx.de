Last week I bought a brand new trombone. Following [my
teacher](https://der-trompetenlehrer.de/)'s recommendation, I made an
appointment at [Musik Bertram](https://www.musik-bertram.com/) in Freiburg and
spent a good few hours in their practice room trying out different instruments.
I fully expected to get a light, small-bore, jazz or pop music tenor trombone.
Instead, I somehow chose a medium-bore, classical [Bach
36](https://www.bachbrass.com/instruments/trombones/professional/36), with
gold-brass bell and everything.

What made the difference compared to the other instruments I tried is the
incredible, full sound this instrument is able to produce. My guitarist
[Max](https://www.youtube.com/user/schmaexle), who was with me at the store, put
it this way:

> The other instruments are good, too. But this one sounds like it has a

Guitarists...

So, amazing sound, yes, but there's a drawback. This instrument is heavier than
anything I have played before. And its geometry is weird, too. I'm still
figuring how to hold it comfortably.

Luckily, there's YouTube. And there's one of my favorite YouTubers: [Trent
Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/c/TrentHamilton). Trent is a New Zealander
that collects brass instruments like others collect stamps. He also plays them
very well, and he plays _all_ of them. Naturally he knows how to properly hold - even a heavy - a
trombone:
