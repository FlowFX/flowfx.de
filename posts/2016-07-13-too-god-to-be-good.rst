`This New York Times article`_ makes some very good observations hat are not only true for the "upscale Polanco neighboorhood":

    Waiters will grab a plate from under your fork. 

    […]
 
    30 servers searched for someone to serve among the restaurant’s 15 diners.

    […]

    In other words: Behind every obsequious waiter is an arrogant customer.

Some interesting information I didn't know before but, judging from my own observations, have no doubt are true:

    The World Economic Forum says Mexico has the second highest level of income inequality among 35 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The 10 percent of Mexico’s population with the highest income use more than one-third of the nation’s resources, while the bottom 10 percent use less than 2 percent.

That's one crazy country.
