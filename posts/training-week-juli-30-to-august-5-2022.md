Since [my training log project](https://github.com/FlowFX/divingdolphin) is
going nowhere, I might as well log my training here, if just for a few weeks.

After a 11 day training break due to Covid I have to ramp back up slowly into my
ongoing volume cycles of clean & press and one-handed club swinging. I am also
trying to start a cycle of Goblet squats in order to add ... more squats to my
training. I think I need them.

## Saturday July 30

**Warmup**
with a 16kg kettlebell: [Around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaegZzSbtr0) (2 x 20/20), [Halo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25xdtjbFPtw) (2 x 5/5),
[Around the world front to back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwlQQXAQpaQ) (10 x 1/1), [Halo Goblet Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAZDLFzdLE) (10 reps).
