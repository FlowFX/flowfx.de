<html><body><p>Two weeks ago, between Christmas and New Year's, I attended the <a title="26c3.de" href="http://www.26c3.de/">26th Chaos Communication Congress</a> (26c3) in Berlin, the anual hackers conference organized by the <a title="CCC e.V." href="http://www.ccc.dd">Chaos Computer Club</a>. I had never been to any c3 before, and I didn't know anyone else attending. So I was rather excited about what would happen there.

Long story short: It was a very inspiring experience. I saw and met many people with (on the first glance) crazy ideas, who didn't wait but just acted on those ideas (e.g. <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3637.en.html">3d-printing at home</a>, <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3550.en.html">finally playing well known game shows with interesting questions</a>, or <a href="http://scytale.name/blog/2009/11/jedem-seine-wikipedia">saving Wikipedia</a>).

One of the most interesting talks for me personally was Audrey Penven speaking about <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3579.en.html">"Photography and the Art of Doing it Wrong"</a>, the essence of which was: Whenever you do something, and you make a mistake, or the technology fails you, try looking on the bright side and explore the possibilities these mistakes offer. Audrey talked a lot about doing photography in ways everyone else would consider wrong. But by doing it wrong, she - and many others - create wonderful art you couldn't do any other way. Too see what I mean you should look at <a href="http://www.audreypenven.net/">Audrey's webpage</a> and <a href="http://mirror.fem-net.de/CCC/26C3/mp4/26c3-3579-en-photography_and_the_art_of_doing_it_wrong.mp4">download the recording of her talk</a>.

btw: Almost every talk at 26c3 was recorded and can be downloaded from <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/wiki/Conference_Recordings">the conference webpage.</a>

To further illustrate this, I am happy to present one creative mistake myself. Of course it's a musical recording, specifically an early rehearsal recording of <a href="http://www.theuplifters.de">our</a> keyboarder's top hit single "It's Not You". Here, her voice is amplified via a bass guitar amp only because the rehearsal room PA was not there that night. This makes for a great and very fitting sound in this song, and we'll have to play with that kind of stuff much more often I think. Here you go:
