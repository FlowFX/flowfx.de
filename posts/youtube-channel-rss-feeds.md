For mostly unknown reasons I want to delete my Google account at some point in the future. The Google services that I am regularly using are Search, Maps, and - increasingly - YouTube. The latter is the only service that really benefits from an account that remembers subscriptions, lists and the history of watched videos.

What I _will_ continue to use are RSS readers. And it turns out that you can (still) subscribe to YouTube channels via their RSS feeds. [Reddit is your friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7meku7/alternative_to_youtube_account_youtube_rss/) and provides the answers:

The URL for a channel's RSS feed is `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id= + channel_id` where the channel ID can be found in the html source of the channel page or may even be part of the channel URL. In any case, I now subscribe to my YouTube channels via boring, old RSS feeds.
