There are several ways to live, and many more in Mexico City. [Nick Farr](https://twitter.com/Nickf4rr) and I have joined up to talk about life and food in Mexico. We named this English language podcast

[**Several Ways To Live In Mexico**](https://severalwaystolive.com/).

Today we released [episode 2](https://severalwaystolive.com/sw002-fonda-fina/), and we have enough topics to produce quite some more.
